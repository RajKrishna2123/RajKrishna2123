### 3. random_face_generator 
**Institute:** Dit University
**Duration:** MAR 2024  

**Link:** [random_poission_blended_face_generator](https://github.com/RajKrishna2123/random_poission_blended_face_generator)
- Developed an Application that can assisted help its user to generate a random face from the feature either they select (from provided) or provide themselves.  
- This project utilises the poison blending technique with mask to paste features like eyes nose and mouth to the face by blending the edges according to the provided image.  
- Tech stack: Django, HTML, CSS, OpenCV.
## Institute and Individual Projects

### 1. Rock Segmentation
**Institute:** IIT Dhanbad  
**Development Period:** June - July 2023

**link:** [Rock_Segmentation](https://github.com/RajKrishna2123/Rock_Segmentation) 
- Developed a rock segmentation model for early landslide detection and warning system.
- its a rock segmentastion and classification model that detects edges seperate each rock then classifies into big, medium, small rocks    
- Tech stack: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Image Segmentation, Python.

### 2. Mini Map
